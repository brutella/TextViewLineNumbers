# NSTextView with Line Numbers

This sample project shows how to create a `NSTextView` with line numbers using a `NSRulerView` subclass. 

The main focus of this project is to provide a simple way of displaying line numbers with good performance also for thousands of lines. The implementation was extracted from the great [CotEditor](https://github.com/coteditor/CotEditor) project - I only converted it to Swift.
